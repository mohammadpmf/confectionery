<span style="font-size: 3em">confectionery</span>
# A real django project to present myself as a senior back-end developer

### Description of Project
In this project, I'm going to design a confectionery (pastry shop) with full features of a real project. Registering with phone number, ordering, writing comments and other things with online payment. I'm going to use docker. The databse is MySql and I hope this project help me to improve my programming skills.

## blah blah blah part üòÅ
I've Started this project at 31 Tir 1403. I've downloaded 3 templates from [free css] and I'm going to use one of the as my front-end files.
<br>
I'm writing theese things for learning a bit about **<span style="color:brown; background-color:#349514; font-family:consolas; font-size:1.2em;">Mark Down</span>** and I'm testing something like **Bold texts**, *Italic texts*, ***both Bold and Italic texts*** <ins>underlined texts in github which has used ins tag</ins> and some other things. So don't bother yourself to read this notes üòä
<br>
It's similar to HTML and easy to learn. You can use <span style="color:green">span tag to use color in your  text</span> or in <span style="background-color:green">background-color</span> or in <span style="font-family: Cursive">font-family</span> or in <span style="font-size: 2em">font-size</span> or ...
<br>
It's enough for now. Let's Start the real project.
